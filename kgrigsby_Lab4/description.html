				<h2>Description, Photos, and Sources</h2>
				<h3>Description</h3>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The slide show you saw in the 'SlideShow' section of the website<br/>
				uses a combination of techniques in order to present those photos in<br/>
				in the order that they appear. First, the box in which they appear, or<br/>
				the 'slider' works alongside a mask that allows the photos to give the<br/>
				appearance of appearing and disappearing. 
				</p>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, to help further the aforementioned effect, the photos<br/>
				themselves react to a specified changing degree of opacity as they move<br/>
				through the slide, giving them a graceful movement throughout the duration<br/>
				of the show.
